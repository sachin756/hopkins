Chicken</div>
<p>
Everybody loves chicken, and when it's roasted with lemon and garlic, the skin becomes crisp and flavorful, the meat is tender and juicy, and the pan juices are rich and savory. This is one of the easiest elegant dinner menus. You can make the creamy potato casserole ahead of time and store it in the fridge until it's time to bake it. The fresh fruit salad can also be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator, tightly covered.

Iced cappuccinos or cappuccini freddo are a cold version of the hot cappuccino
